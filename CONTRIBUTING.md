## How to contribute to TWGL.js

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Check the [Contribution Guidelines](#Contribution Guidelines) below.
4. Make changes to your clone of the repository.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Contrubution Guidelines

*  Always make your contributions for the latest dev branch, not master.
*  Create separate branches per patch or feature.
*  Once done with a patch / feature do not add more commits to a feature branch (pull requests are not repository state snapshots, any change you do in that branch will be included in the pull request).
*  If you add a new feature it's good to add also an example (both for showing how it's used and for testing it still works after eventual refactorings).
*  If you add some assets for the examples (like textures, models, sounds, etc), make sure they have a proper license allowing for their use here (less restrictive the better).
*  If you modify existing code (refactoring / optimization / bug fix), run relevant examples to check they didn't break or that there wasn't some performance regress.
*  Watch out for eslint and uglify errors when building the libs, there should not be any.
*  If some GitHub issue is relevant to patch / feature, it's good to mention issue number with hash (e.g. #2774) in a commit message to get cross-reference in GitHub web interface.
*  Format whitespace consistently with the rest of code base.
*  Don't include `docs` or `dist` files in pull requests.

## Building

1.  install [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2.  install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com)

   The simple way to do this is open a shell or terminal and type

       sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

   On windows remove the `sudo`.

3.  cd into the TWGL folder and type

       npm install

4.  You should now be able to build TWGL by typing

       grunt

5.  You can build the docs by typing

       grunt docs

## Developing

If you're trying to debug something you added to TWGL there are 2 common ways

1.  Use the non minified versions.

    Change the `<script src="twgl-full.min.js">` to `<script src="twgl-full.js">`.

    You still have to build after every change but at least the file will be readable.

2.  Use the [requirejs AMD](http://requirejs.org) version

    require.js is a JavaScript library that provides way for scripts to include other scripts
    without having to manually put in script tags. You add just the require.js script to your
    page with a special `data-main` attribute. It loads your main script and any scripts
    those scripts depend on etc. There's [an example if using TWGL this way here](http://twgljs.org/examples/amd.html).

    The advantage to this method is you don't have to compile the scripts because it uses
    the source scripts. The disadvantage is your main script must
    be in a separate file. It can't not be embedded in the HTML AFAIK.

## Running

The easiest way to run TWGL locally is to run a webserver. Type

    sudo npm install http-server -g

Remove the `sudo` if on Windows.

Now anytime you want to run TWGL examples locally cd to the TWGL folder
and type

    http-server

Then in your browser go to `http://localhost:8080`

    http://localhost:8080/examples/tiny.html

To quit the web server type Ctrl-C.
